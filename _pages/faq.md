1.  **Is trial version of symbol server available? **Sure, the trial version may be downloaded from the Download section. The installer will try to retrieve your unique trial license from our website. Trial license is valid for a month, and the full functionality is available during this period. If installer fails with the retrieving of product license, you have to install it manually. In this case, grab the license from the appropriate link in Downloads section.<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </strong>
2.  **How do I install the trial version? **You just need to launch the product installer downloaded from our website and follow the wizard steps. After installation completes, a browser windows will appear, showing the symbol server start page. Here you have a link to the web panel, link to the installer of command line tool, and instructions for setting up the environment variables on developer machines.
3.  **Is Microsoft IIS required for the installation?** Only .NET Framework 4.5 is required for symbol server to work.
4.  **I love only IIS web server. Are you gonna support it?** Yes, the IIS support has been scheduled. Currently the symbol server uses nginx for propagate symbols over the network.
5.  **I have a very specific environment. Can you help me integrate your solution into my infrastructure?** Yes, we do provide a help with integration of our solutions. In very complex scenarios the "live" sessions are possible via TeamViewer.
